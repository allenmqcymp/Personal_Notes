    "\n",
    "Best illustrated by an example\n",
    "\n",
    "- Resizing array \n",
    "\n",
    "- To resize, when the array is full, we double the size. Adding elements is `O(1)`, but doubling the size involves copying n elements across, which takes n operations depending on n.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This would indicate that adding n elements to a resizing array is `O(log n)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, this is unfair, as after each double, we get to add many more elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, doubling from 8 to 16 allows 8 more additional elements at `O(1)` to be added.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we divide number of cumulative operations / number of elements, we find that this number is constant (if we ignore minimal array overhead)\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is amortized analysis: in practical application, doubling an array is so infrequent and also opens up more potential operations that it makes more sense to evaluate this operation as having **constant amortized time**\n",
